                    <p>Why is this site important and who is this for?</p>
                    <p>As a black woman, we are not easily reconignzed in the society of beauty. Our melatted skin, course hair, and revoultionary backround has left us with a stigma of being something that others "dont want", or would not "want to be". Due to this adversity in life we tend to shine away from stranding out, being different and owning our truth. With Ireccostyle we are reminding our beautiful black women that they are reconignized, seen and heard! Our site recommends a styple that goes with ypu beautiful black woman. This is a recommendation based off of faceshapes of only "black women".</p>
